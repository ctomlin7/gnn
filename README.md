# GNN Workspace

### Purpose

This workspace is designed to allow the user to test multiple graph neural network architectures for both regression tasks and classification tasks. The main function of this repo is to allow for that experimentation via a Docker container for rapid development. The secondary goal of this project is to learn how to webscrape for dowloadable files and parse those files for the desired information. This will result in a nearly fully automated pipeline of data acquisition, database creation, and machine learning architecture. 

### Usage
